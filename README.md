C# console application to ease the packing process of mods for Dovetail Games' Train Sim WorldÂ® on Unreal Engine 4.26 (TSW 3 + TSW 2 post Rush Hour update)

## Requirements

- You can use a computer that can execute exe-files

## How to use

### Arguments:
- Mod content path
  - Folder above the `TS2Prototype` Folder, this folder should otherwise be empty
- Pak filename/path *(optional, will default to `TSWpak-output.pak` in the current directory)*
- UnrealPak.exe path *(optional)*

### Example:
Input:  
```Shell
TSWpak.exe "G:\TSWMods\Mod\Cooked Files" "G:\TSWMods\Mod\TSWpakExample.pak"
```
  
***Pro-tip:***

Output:  
```
It looks like there is no default UnrealPak.exe path specified, please enter one bellow! If confirmed working, it will be used as the default path if no path is given. You can use the command "reset" to reset the path if anything goes wrong.
